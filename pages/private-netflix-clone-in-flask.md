I have been working on a project that creates a private video gallery!

It's perfect for your own use.

Here's some features:

  * Authentication
  * Automated adding of new videos
  * Subtitle support (via mediaelement player)
  * Automatic movie info retrieval (Need RottenTomatoes free API key for this)
  * Secure file serving using X-Accel-Redirect header

You can find the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/fisle/netflask).
