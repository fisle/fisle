I mean come on! I used to be a PHP-only developer. Thought nothing of the syntax, sometimes just wondering why there has to be *semicolon* at the end of every line. Oh well, keep coding anyway.

But then - something happend - I tried Python. *Lol forced indentation? Come on*! *No curly braces around loops/if-statements/etc? Lol how dumb.*

I went forward though. Soon I realized how wonderful it was, everything was so simple. No more syntax error because forgot curly brace or semicolon. Indentation made everything clear enough. Python does not **feel** like a programming language, <small>(inb4 someone says that PHP isn't proper one anyway)</small> because it is **so easy** to work with. The flow is amazing, everything feels so logical and natural, it almost feels unreal. Every time I have to do PHP nowadays, my syntax is f'd up at the beginning because I am thinking in Python. The curly braces, semicolons and everything don't feel logical anymore. Fuck that, I wanna do Python instead!
