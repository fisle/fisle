I decided to open the source of this small blog.

There's not much code, since it's a pretty basic Flask-FlatPages with Frozen-Flask combination.

In addition there's a small post publishing script, [deploy.sh](https://github.com/fisle/fisle/blob/master/deploy.sh).

Anyway, you can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/fisle/fisle). Go check it out!
